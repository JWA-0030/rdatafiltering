Create one .R file named GettingStartedWith.R. It will be submitted on the webcourse. Download and use the file that is on the webcourse in the files section named hw1_data.csv.
For all even day numbers (days 2, 4, 6, 8, etc) in June, with a Wind value greater than 9, find the mean of the Wind column. Your function name must be RAssignment1Problem1.
For all records with no NA columns, find the minimum and maximum values in the Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp columns. Your function name must be RAssignment1Problem2. You will need to create a new dataset as follows with the first data row being the min and the data row second row being the max:
Ozone         Solar.R       Wind Temp

5                 6                 7        8

10               11               12      13                <-- these numbers are made up examples
